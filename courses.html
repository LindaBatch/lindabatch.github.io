            	<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Final Grade:</span> *in progress</p>
            	<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Course Description:</span> Humans continuously learn from the time they are born using a continuous feedback process. Various mechanisms are used for collecting information, analyzing it and producing output. If the output is not satisfactory, corrections are made next time to produce a better output. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational networked structures that are based on the above concept and the structure of brain cells called neurons. ANNs are composed of artificial neurons which work like the brain neurons, each performing a very simple task but when connected as a network, are able to learn gradually as humans enabling machine intelligence. Genetic Algorithms (GA) present another type of machine learning technique that is based on the concepts of evolution where better solutions are derived by using many iterations or generations of trial and errors. The process starts with a random set of solutions which gradually gets refined by creating new solutions from the old ones until no further significant improvements can be achieved. These machine learning techniques are showing promising results for certain problem domains where all the data are not known in advance, and where machines need to continuously learn to adapt to the changing stimuli or situation. The brain-like ANNs have been used to model human cognition, perception, and memory. Recently these techniques are also being applied to train and refine the knowledge of robots which are used in many critical applications such as fire-fighting and medical surgery. You will learn different ANNs and GAs in this course, models of ANNs for human cognition, and how these techniques are used in problem solving such as classification, clustering, optimization and data reduction. You will need to develop software programs (using any programming language such as C, C++, Matlab, Java) that apply some of these algorithms to solve real world problems. By the end of the course, you will know the significant ANNs and GA techniques, have experience in writing software programs that implement some of these algorithms to solve practical problems, and get an idea of the ongoing research in this area in various application domains.</p>

            	<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Course Description:</span> An introduction to the basic principles and tools of artificial intelligence. Problem solving methods and knowledge representation techniques.</p>
            	<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has existed as a recognizably distinct field of study for about five decades. Historically, AI emphasized reasoning and thought processes and fidelity to human models. More recent work has shifted the focus to include the actions that artificial systems perform, and the application of an ideal standard of rationality to that behaviour. This first course in Artificial Intelligence provides students an introduction to the field, presenting some of the major ideas that have emerged from the roughly past half century of AI research.</p>

            	<p>In the past, students entered Computing programs with little or no computing experience. They were required from the very beginning to learn the Unix user interface and conventions for files, directories, permissions and processes. They acquired experience of software-development techniques and tools incrementally in subsequent courses. But increasingly, students have been starting Computing programs with considerable experience using graphical user interfaces on Windows and Mac computers, and our introductory courses have been taking advantage of this prior experience. As a consequence of this, the students have not been acquiring a foundation of system-level concepts on which subsequent courses can build and have been graduating without any opportunity to learn the basics of Unix-like systems and widely used system-level software-development techniques and tools. The aim of this course is to provide this opportunity.</p>

            	<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Course Description:</span> Introduction to techniques for specifying the behaviour of software, with applications of these techniques to design, verification and construction of software. Logic-based techniques such as loop invariants and class invariants. Automata and grammar-based techniques, with applications to scanners, parsers, user-interface dialogs and embedded systems. Computability issues in software specifications. </p>
            	<p>This course is intended to provide students in 2nd or 3rd year of a Computing program essential material on formal languages and automata, and on imperative program specification using logical predicates. Such material is often taught from either a purely theoretical point of view (for example, emphasizing complexity hierarchies or completeness results) or from a strictly practical point of view (for example, in courses on compilers or software validation); the aim here is to demonstrate the practical use of mathematically-based Computing Science. The topics have been chosen because they are both theoretical and practical. The material on formal languages is integrated into a specification-oriented framework by treating state diagrams, regular expressions, and context-free grammars as specialized specification languages: formalisms for specifying language recognizers. Computability issues arise because certain specifications are unimplementable.</p>

            	<p>After completing the course, students will have a toolkit of data structures and algorithms that they can select from and implement when solving programming problems and developing software, and they should know how to analyze problems in order to judge which of these are most efficient and appropriate for use in a particular situation. They should also be able to develop their own variations and combinations of data structures to fit new situations and be able to analyse their efficiency and usefulness.</p>
